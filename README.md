<br>
Simple page to assist poker games. Place chip nominals, set blinds amount separated by space, specify other settings and start the timer - blinds will update automatically. My first experience of hosting something on GitHub pages.
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No screen fading</li>
  <li>All values are stored in cookies. Time is updated every 5 seconds</li>
  <li>Sound signal 1 minute before, and shortly before blinds change. Can be turned off</li>
  <li>Chip giveaway formula based on fixed amount of chips in storage (50, 50, 100, 50, 50)</li>
  <li>Adaptive layout (to the current degree of my knowledge)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backlog:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add easy RU/EN switch</li>
  <li>Add smarter chip count system (for every player)</li>
</ul>
